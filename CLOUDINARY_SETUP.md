## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Cloudinary Account

1. Go to [https://cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
2. Click "Sign Up for Free"
3. Create your account (you can use Google/GitHub sign-in)
4. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Get Your Cloudinary Credentials

1. After logging in, you'll be on the Dashboard
2. Find the **Account Details** section
3. Copy these three values:
   - **Cloud Name**
   - **API Key**
   - **API Secret**

### Step 3: Configure Backend

1. Open `satocii-backend/index.js`
2. Find lines 13-17 (Cloudinary Configuration section)
3. Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials:

```javascript
// Cloudinary Configuration
cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: 'YOUR_CLOUD_NAME',     // Replace with your cloud name
  api_key: 'YOUR_API_KEY',           // Replace with your API key
  api_secret: 'YOUR_API_SECRET'      // Replace with your API secret
});
```

**Example:**
```javascript
cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: 'myawesomeapp',
  api_key: '123456789012345',
  api_secret: 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234'
});
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies (If Not Already Done)

Navigate to the backend directory and install packages:

```bash
cd satocii-backend
npm install
```

This will install:
- `cloudinary` - Cloudinary SDK
- `multer` - File upload middleware

### Step 5: Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd satocii-backend
node index.js
```

You should see:
```
Connected to MongoDB
Server is running on http://localhost:5000
```

### Step 6: Test the Integration

1. Open your browser and go to your LinkedIn page (http://localhost:3000/linkedin)
2. Try uploading an image:
   - Click "Choose Image" button
   - Select an image from your computer
   - Wait for upload confirmation
   - Image should appear in the preview grid

## How It Works

### Image Upload Flow

1. **User selects image** ‚Üí Frontend validates file (type & size)
2. **Frontend sends to backend** ‚Üí `/api/upload-image` endpoint receives file
3. **Backend uploads to Cloudinary** ‚Üí Image stored in `linkedin-posts` folder
4. **Cloudinary returns URL** ‚Üí Secure HTTPS URL sent back to frontend
5. **Frontend stores URL** ‚Üí URL added to `uploadedImages` array
6. **User creates post** ‚Üí URLs saved to MongoDB with post data

### Post to LinkedIn Option

#### Checkbox Checked (Default)
- Post is created on LinkedIn
- Data is saved to MongoDB
- Status: `posted` or `failed`
- `postToLinkedIn: true`

#### Checkbox Unchecked
- Post is NOT created on LinkedIn
- Data is ONLY saved to MongoDB
- Status: `saved`
- `postToLinkedIn: false`

---

## Database Schema Changes

### New Fields Added to Post Model

```javascript
{
  uploadedImages: [String],           // Array of Cloudinary image URLs
  postToLinkedIn: Boolean,            // Whether to post to LinkedIn (default: true)
  // ... existing fields
}
```

---

## API Endpoints

  "data": {
    "url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/xxx/image/upload/v123/linkedin-posts/abc123.jpg",
    "publicId": "linkedin-posts/abc123",
    "format": "jpg",
    "width": 1920,

## Cloudinary Folder Structure

```
cloudinary.com/your-cloud-name/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ linkedin-posts/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image1.jpg
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image2.png
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ image3.webp
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to upload image to Cloudinary"

**Solutions:**
1. Check Cloudinary credentials in `satocii-backend/index.js`
2. Verify Cloudinary account is active
3. Check internet connection
4. Look at backend console for detailed error

### Issue: Images not showing in preview

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Cloudinary URL is valid (HTTPS)
3. Check if images array is populated in formData
4. Ensure Image component is properly imported from Next.js

### Issue: "Post saved" but not showing in LinkedIn

**Solutions:**
1. Check if `postToLinkedIn` checkbox was checked
2. Look at post status in Posts History tab
3. If status is "saved" instead of "posted", the checkbox was unchecked
4. This is expected behavior - data is only in database, not on LinkedIn

### Issue: Backend not starting

**Solutions:**
1. Run `npm install` in `satocii-backend` directory
2. Check if MongoDB connection string is valid
3. Verify port 5000 is not in use
4. Check Node.js version (requires v14+)

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Considerations:**

1. **API Credentials**: Never commit Cloudinary credentials to version control
   - Use environment variables in production
   - Add `.env` file to `.gitignore`

2. **File Upload Security**:
   - Backend validates file types
   - File size is limited to 10MB
   - Multer prevents malicious uploads

3. **Image URLs**: Cloudinary URLs are public
   - Anyone with the URL can view the image
   - Don't upload sensitive information

---

## Production Deployment

For production, use environment variables:

### 1. Create `.env` file in `satocii-backend`:
```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000
```

### 2. Update `index.js`:
```javascript
require('dotenv').config();

cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
  api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
});
```

### 3. Install dotenv:
```bash
npm install dotenv
```

---

## Additional Features You Can Add

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Multiple images upload** - Allow dragging multiple files
2. **Image cropping** - Add crop functionality before upload
3. **Video support** - Extend to support video uploads
4. **Image compression** - Compress before uploading
5. **Progress bar** - Show upload progress percentage
6. **Cloudinary transformations** - Resize, filter, or optimize images

---

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Cloudinary documentation: https://cloudinary.com/documentation
2. Review backend console logs
3. Check browser console for frontend errors
4. Verify all credentials are correct
